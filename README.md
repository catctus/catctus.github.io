My little blog, website and also my first C project. A static website generator called blog-gen. 
It converts markdown to html and includes some methods to combine header, footer and update a 
list of all the blog posts. The goal was to create something to get more familiar with C and also have somewhere
to blog and keep track of my journey. Not sure if it's ever going to be used / updated, but it was a fun exercise. 

`bloggen -c /some/markdown.md /other/output.tml`
`bloggen -u /some/folder/with/posts`
`bloggen -h`
