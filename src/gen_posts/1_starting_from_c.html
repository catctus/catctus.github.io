<h2>Starting from C </h2>
<em>12 dec 2023</em></p>

My first blog post! <br>
For a little while now, maybe three months (?) I have been learning C. 
I started out with some udemy courses, first <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/">this beginner course</a> and then <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-c-programming-course/">this advance course</a>.<br>
When it comes to learning I have developed some stratagies: First I try to find some good resources, like 
a book or an online course. Then I also try to mix in some kind of projects. I think this works with most things, even if its not related to coding. <em>(if you are learning german a project could be to just read an article in German)</em> <br>
To get my hands dirty I wanted to try and write a small program that could compile <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markup</a> to html. I then continued and made it into a <a href="https://github.com/catctus/catctus.github.io/tree/main/src">static blog generator</a>, this site.  
Another thing that I think is useful when learning especially when it comes to programming languages etc is to look at how things are actually done. Like looking at some popular libraries on github etc. <br>
I decided to try and follow <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">this</a>, building an intepreted language from scratch. 
This for me was super interesting as I have been coding in Python for quite sometime. Even though I tried to read it carefully a lot of things went over my stupid head. But it's alright, as I saw a lot of concepts I learned being used for something. Like linked lists, Stacks, how hashtables works and much more. Now I have a pretty good understanding how a langague like python is built!<br>
Amazing.   <br>
From following that book I have also realized how bad my markdown to html compiler is and how I could have made 
things differently. But thats ok, I guess that means I have learned something. I will definitely get back to writing compilers and langagues in the future.
But before that I want to go deeper and learn some assambly. </p>
