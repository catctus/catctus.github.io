<h2>Starting from C </h2>
<em>12 dec 2023</em></p>

This is my first blog post. Finally done with this static blog generator that I coded in C.<br>
It's quite a simple program and the code is <em>preetty</em> messy, but it was a great project to introduce me to the language.<br>
Also a good compliment to the two courses I took on udemy, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/">this beginner course</a>, and then <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-c-programming-course/">this advance course</a>.
<br>My goal was first to create a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markup</a> to html compiler/converter, 
but took it a bit I further and made it into a blog generator that I called <a href="https://github.com/catctus/catctus.github.io/tree/main/src">bloggen</a>.<br>
My next project will be to implement some standard data types and try to use void pointers to make them generic (linked lists, stack, queues and binary trees). <br>
Then I'll jump on <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">this</a> and build an intepreter language. <br>to be continued..
