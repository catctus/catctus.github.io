##Starting from C 
*12 dec 2023*

This is my first blog post. Finally done with this static blog generator that I coded in C.<br>
It's quite a simple program and the code is *preetty* messy, but it was a great project to introduce me to the language.<br>
Also a good compliment to the two courses I took on udemy, [this beginner course](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/), and then [this advance course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-c-programming-course/).
<br>My goal was first to create a [markup](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to html compiler/converter, 
but took it a bit I further and made it into a blog generator that I called [bloggen](https://github.com/catctus/catctus.github.io/tree/main/src).<br>
My next project will be to implement some standard data types and try to use void pointers to make them generic (linked lists, stack, queues and binary trees). <br>
Then I'll jump on [this](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and build an intepreter language. <br>to be continued..
