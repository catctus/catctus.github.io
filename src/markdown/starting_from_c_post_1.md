#Starting from C 

I just started learning C and as a first project I created a markdown to html converter that I 
could use to generate this site! It can also combined header, footer and update some lists.
*It's pretty basic..* but it got most of the standard [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
