<h1>Starting from C </h1>
<p>
I just started learning C and as a first project I created a markdown to html converter that I 
could use to generate this site! It can also combined header, footer and update some lists.
<em>It's pretty basic..</em> but it got most of the standard <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">markdown syntax</a></p>
